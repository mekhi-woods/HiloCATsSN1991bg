# Mass Step of Type-1a Supernova 1991bg
This repository works to analyze and calculate the mass step function of Supernovae Type Ia using forced photometry data from the ATLAS and ZTF surveys. This project is a segment of the collaboration 'Hilo Cosmology And Transients (CATs)', an initiative operative from the University of Hawaii.
